                   <h1> Haikyuu!! </h1>
                   <p> Haikyuu is a volleyball anime. Hinata, the main character, began playing volleyball after watching a TV show while riding his bike. He practiced volleyball alone because their school did not have a volleyball club. He loved volleyball and decided to join the tournament, but due to the lack of players, he couldn't join. To solve this problem, he persuaded his companions to participate, which they lost. From that day forward, He pledged to defeat the person who defeated their team, Kageyama. He played volleyball till he graduated from high school. His dream high school was Karasuno, and he was overjoyed when he arrived there until he met Kageyama. Hinata will no longer be able to defeat Kageyama because he will become his teammate... </p>
