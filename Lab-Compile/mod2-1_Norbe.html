            <p> This is a webpage. I love Computer Science. </p>
            <p> When I opened the webpage, I saw the sentence I had inserted between the tags. The sentence shown was placed to the left rather than the center. It's also a regular sentence with a normal font size and a simple font design. I also observed that the title I placed in the head portion showed up in the tab. </p>
